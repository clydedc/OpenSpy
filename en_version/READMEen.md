## Usage

Once installed, you can use the tool directly from the terminal to perform searches. Here's how:

### IP Address Lookup

This feature allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific IP address.

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter the IP address and display information such as city, country, organization, and more.

### Advanced Google Search with allintext

You can perform advanced Google searches using the `allintext` operator. The program will prompt you to enter a query and automatically execute the search.

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will then ask for your `allintext` query and display results, including title, URL, and snippet.

Results will also be saved in a JSON file within the `save/` directory.

## How It Works

### IP Lookup

IP address lookups are performed via the `ipinfo.io` service. When you enter an IP address, the program sends a request to retrieve information about it. The results include city, country, organization, and other relevant details.

### Google allintext Search

Google searches using the `allintext` operator allow you to find highly specific results. After entering a query, the tool performs a search on Google and extracts results from the HTML page, including title, URL, and a snippet for each result.

The results are then saved in a JSON file in the `save/` directory, with a timestamp-based filename for each search performed.
